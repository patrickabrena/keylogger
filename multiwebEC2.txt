AWS hosting multiple websites on a single EC2 instance

- Learning Outcomes

1. Provision secondary private IP address and Elastic IP address
	- In order to allow multiple websites or multiple web pages to run on one EC2 instance, we need elastic addresses or the private ip addresses

2. How to get secondary IP recognized by my OS
	- beccause wheen we launch an EC2 instance it is provided with a single public IP and a single private IP
	
3. Create 2 different web pages on Apache server

4. Associating those web pages with our different elastic IP
	- with those elastic IPs we will be making the webage run
	
ELASTIC IP ADDRESS DEFIINITION
	- static IP address that is associated with our EC2 instance
	
	
- when we stop our instance, the public ip of our instance gets lost

USES OF MULTIPLE IP ADDRESSES

- It can be useful to assign multiple IP addresses to an instance in the Virtual Private Cloud to do the following:
	- Host multiple websites on a single server by using multiple SSL (Secure Socket Layer) certificates
	
	- Operate network appliances such as firewalls or load balancers that have multiple IP addresses for each network interface.
	
	- Redirect internal traffic to a standby instance in case your instance fails, by reassiggning the secondary IP address to the standby instance
	
	
FIRST! What is AWS in simple terms

- AWS is a colletiion of cloud services that interlock to make complex applications. Use Legos as an analogy

	- EC2 is just one lego piece in the whole Amazon Web Services

What is an EC2 instance? (Elastic Cloud Computing)
 - EC2 instancees are virtual computers hosted in AWS that allow for scalable computing capacity in the AWS cloud.
 
 
 FROM AWS MANAGEMENT CONSOLE
	- Select EC2 -> instsances -> launch instances
	- Select Ubuntu AMI (Amazon Machine Image) 
		- AMI is a templatee that contains the software configs (OS, application server, and apps) to launch my instance
	- instance type is free tier in this case t2.micro
	- Create key pair 
		- Make sure keypair is in linux if you're operating
