Highlevel overview of the plan to make this keylogger

1. Learn Apache and how to deploy an AWS EC2 instance server

2. Create 2 elastic IPs by creating a secondary private IP and mapping it to the EIPs

    - Inbetween steps
        - Install jenkins on instance and configure necessary settings where needed

        - Create 2 github repos with test HTML and CSS and maybe JS.
        - Create 2 repos within keylogger repo and git init and the pull code from remote repo into local repo through the regular way
        - Watch Anjali Sharma's video on youtube just before 24:00 for assigning EIP to webpage through vitual host config in the "sites-enabled" (should be 000-default.conf file to modify the virtual hosts)
        - ?? potential create jenkins job to automate the pull from the remote repo into the correct directory located on the EC2 instance 

    - Inbetween steps revised (April 2, 2024)
        - install jenkins on EC2 instance
        - Create 2 remote github repos: hack-page and vic-page and add them as submodules within keylogger repo.
        - create jenkins freestyle project so I can pull code from github repo into directories within "/var/www/html"

3. Learn Jenkins with webhooks for CI/CD 
    

4. Look at the keylogger XSS attack video from old guy because he uses 2 separate web pages for this
